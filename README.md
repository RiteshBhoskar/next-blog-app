This is the link to the deployed project.   :-  https://next-blog-app-riteshbhoskars-projects.vercel.app/

It is a basic blog app where you can add blogs and see them later.
This webpage doesn't have any type of authentication. I will add it soon.

If you want to add the authentication or improve the ui/ux , clone the repo and get started.

This project uses postgresql provided by vercel.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
